Problem statement:

Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"

In this problem, we can't simply compare two integers from the array and sort them, e,g, for numbers 9, 90 if we do simple compare then the number will be 
909 (as 90 > 9) but we should be doing 990 (9 comes first and then 90) in this case as 990 > 909. 

So we need custom compare function where we convert two integers into str and concatenate both of them to generate bott the final numbers like 909 and 990,
and then do string compare between 990 and 909 and then sort the array as per the result.

In python we will use a speacial module from functools import cmp_to_key to achieve this, pls see the .py file of the same name for code.
