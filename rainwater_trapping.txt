https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/


Example 1:


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105


THis is a classic array preprocessing problem, where we create/preprocess the original array into different array to find out the result.
How to find out:
Problems, where the result for a particular index of the original array depends on the left and right index of the current index of the arry, those kind of problems 
falls under this category.

Another example of this type is the candy problem from hackerrank.
